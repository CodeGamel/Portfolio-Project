This guide explains how to access and work with my local website using files from a GitHub repository. Follow these steps to view the Portfolio.

Prerequisites
Git: Ensure Git is installed on your computer. Download Git if needed.
Text Editor/IDE: Use a text editor or IDE such as VS Code, notepad , or Atom.
Steps
1. Clone the GitHub Repository
Find the Repository: Locate the GitHub repository containing the files . For example, https://github.com/username/repository.

Copy the Repository URL: Click the green “Code” button and copy the URL.

Open Terminal/Command Prompt: Open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) on your computer.

Clone the Repository: Run the following command, replacing URL with the copied repository URL:
URL:
git clone URL

Example:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

Navigate to the Repository Folder: Change directory into the cloned repository:
cd repository

2. Locate and Review Files
Find the Files: Look through the repository to locate the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other files relevant to your local website.

Open Files: Use your text editor or IDE to open and review these files. For example:
code index.html

Replace index.html with the file you wish to open.

3. Access the Local Website
Open the Website Locally: To view your website, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. You can do this by:

Dragging and Dropping: Drag the HTML file into your web browser.
Right-Click and Open: Right-click on the HTML file and choose “Open with” followed by your preferred web browser.
Check the Website: Verify that all components of your website are displaying correctly. Make sure that all linked CSS and JavaScript files are working as expected.

4. Make Changes and Save
Edit Files: If you need to make changes, edit the files using your text editor or IDE.

Save Changes: Save your modifications and refresh the web browser to see the changes.

5. Keep Your Repository Updated
Pull Latest Changes: If there are updates to the repository, pull the latest changes to keep your local copy up to date:

git pull origin main

Replace 'main' with the appropriate branch name if necessary.

Commit Your Changes: If you make changes and want to keep track of them, commit your updates:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

Again, replace 'main' with the appropriate branch name if necessary.

By following these steps, you can effectively access and manage my website using files from GitHub. If you have any questions or run into issues, consider reaching out for help from the community or the repository maintainers.

Happy coding!
